   ```
## Setup

1. Create your own `.env` file with the following config variables:
- POSTGRES_USER
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD
- POSTGRES_DB
- POSTGRES_HOST
- POSTGRES_PORT
- ALGORITHM
- JWT_SECRET_KEY
- ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES
- MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS
- BLOCK_TIME

2. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- Running Docker Compose will create images for the backend, the database, and Alembic within a single network.
- This setup ensures the database is automatically migrated to the latest schema version, and all services can communicate seamlessly with each other.
   
## Usage

1. Run services from main directory:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

2. Check the health endpoint:
    Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/health  
    You should see the JSON response:  
    ```json
    {"status":"ok"}
    ```
3. API Documentation

   The backend exposes a RESTful API with interactive documentation automatically generated by FastAPI.  
   Once the application is running, you can access the API docs here:  
   [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)  

   This interface allows you to explore available endpoints, view request and response schemas, and test the API directly from your browser.
